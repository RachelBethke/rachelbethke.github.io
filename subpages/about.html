                <p>Hi again! I'm Rachel Bethke, and I'm a 3rd year studying computer science at Cornell originally from Tallahassee, Florida. 
                    I enjoy learning across computer science, but I’m especially drawn to working close to the metal.
                    I love aerospace, running, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155807542-rachel-b">reading</a>.
                     <br> <br> Currently Reading: <em>Jane Eyre</em> by Charlotte Brontë

                <h3>background</h3>
                <p>
                My first exposure to both aerospace and computer science came during my junior year of high school. I took a computer science principles class
                and joined my school’s <a href="https://studentastronautchallenge.net/challenges">Astronaut Challenge</a> team at a friend’s request.
                Both experiences ended up shaping what I wanted to pursue. <br> The following year, I became captain of the team.
                We were the first all-female team to compete and earned my school’s first overall win. At the same time, I was taking AP Computer Science,
                which confirmed that I wanted to continue studying CS in college. </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>cuair</h3>
                    <p>As an autopilot software developer on Cornell Unmanned Air Systems, I’ve worked on projects of varying scope,
                    all centered around student-built autonomous VTOL UAVs, and it’s been one of the most rewarding parts of college.
                    <br> Beyond writing code, I’ve learned how to work on cross-functional teams with mechanical and electrical engineers,
                    tackle underdefined problems, and test software on real hardware. I've even been used as extra hands for the mechanical team
                    during drone fabrication! More than anything, I’ve learned how to enjoy the process and the importance of working on
                    projects I'm passionate about.</p>

                <h3>track & field</h3>
                <p>I compete in the 400m dash as a sprinter for Cornell's NCAA D1 team. Although injuries have kept me from running off and
                    on for most of my collegiate career, I love the sport. I think juggling practices, classes, CUAir, and TA responsibilities 
                    has given me a discipline I could only have gotten through division I athletics. I know how to work well on teams 
                    with people from different backgrounds, respond well to feedback, and know how to thrive under pressure.</p>
